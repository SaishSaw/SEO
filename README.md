🌐"Unlocking the Secrets of Search Engines: A Journey into AI-driven Discovery"🌐


In today's tech landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn't just a buzzword; it's the cornerstone reshaping how we navigate the digital realm. Search engines, the gatekeepers to vast pools of online information, are undergoing a transformative evolution fueled by AI integration. With machine learning at their core, modern search engines are no longer mere tools but intelligent assistants, finely tuned to anticipate and fulfill user needs.

Imagine a world where every keystroke yields precisely what you seek – that's the promise of AI-driven search engines. Through advanced algorithms and data-driven insights, these platforms continuously optimize performance, ensuring users find what they're looking for with unparalleled efficiency.

But what factors truly influence their performance? How do features like organic search results, Product Listing Ads (PLAs), top ads, and merchant domains impact user experience? This is where our project comes in.

🔍 Unlocking the Power of Search Queries: Delving into Semantic Understanding

In the realm of machine learning for search engine optimization, delving into the semantics of user search queries is paramount. Our journey led us to explore traditional methods of data cleaning, stop-word removal, and tokenization, culminating in the utilization of the word2vec model for generating embeddings.

However, amidst our exploration, we encountered two pivotal challenges:

* Loss of Global Structure: As we ventured into transforming embeddings into lower-dimensional spaces, the risk of losing vital information loomed large. This often resulted in misleading clusters or the absence thereof.

* Understanding Search Queries: Simply tokenizing and embedding words posed a conundrum. An embedding for "java," for instance, could ambiguously represent either a programming language or the aromatic delight of coffee.

To surmount these hurdles, we embraced the innovative approach of sentence transformers. By harnessing these transformers, we could encapsulate the entire context of a sentence within its embedding, offering a holistic perspective.

For our sentence embeddings, we leveraged the pre-trained model "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" from Hugging Face. With these embeddings in hand, we seamlessly implemented PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to condense dimensionality while preserving 80% of the data's variance.
